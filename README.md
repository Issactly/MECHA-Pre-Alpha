# MECHA Pre-Alpha

## Update 05/24/2025:
**PC:**
Players can walk, sprint w/Lshift, crouch w/C and see what direction other players are looking to. Walk speeds change accordingly and jump is disabled while crouching. Accidentally made the crouch good(???) You can _tap_ C to crouch, then any other movement key input will make the character stand or you can *hold* to stay crouched no matter the other movement key inputs.

**Console:**
Players can walk, sprint while holding ButtonL3, and see what direction other players are looking to. Walk speeds change accordingly

Support for Mobile begins next week. While mobile players can join the game, their walk speed by default is less than crouch speed(?)(I honestly don't know why lmao)
